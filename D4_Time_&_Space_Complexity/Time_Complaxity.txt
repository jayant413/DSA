What is TIME COMPLAXITY ?
->
   1. Time taken by a algorithm to run
      as a function of length of input 

For-> 
     - Comparision of algorithm.
     - Making better program.


    Big O notation : Upper bound in worst case complaxity
    theta " "      : Average complaxity
    Omega " "      : Lower bound in best case complaxity


* Increase complaxity as go down in below list
  
Costant time     - O(1)
Logarithmic time - O(log n)   ; Binary search 
Linear  time     - O(n)
                 - O(n log n)
Quadratic   time - O(n^2)
Cube    time     - O(n^3)  
                 - O(2^n)
                 - O( n! )
